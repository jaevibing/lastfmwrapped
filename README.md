# lastfmwrapped
Get your Spotify wrapped early with last.fm! 

This script will get all songs scrobbled on last.fm from the beginning of the year until Oct 31 of the same year to show you what your Spotify wrapped will look like before it's released!

Requires a last.fm API account. Before using make sure to replace the placeholder values in the script with your API key and the last.fm username you wish to scan.
